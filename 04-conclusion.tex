\chapter{Conclusion}
The conclusion should highlight the most important findings in your work and at the same time form an answer to what is stated in the hypothesis for the work. This chapter is one which is often read carefully and therefore extra care should be taken when writing the conclusions. In order to make the conclusion readable it might be necessary to rephrase and repeat parts of the hypothesis in order to remain the reader. Remember to keep it short and precise (max. a couple of pages)
 
\section{Further work}
The conclusion might contain a section devoted to what you think could be important for further investigations. This section should rather explain a few important ideas thoroughly than providing all the ideas (including the less important) the author might come up with. At the same time it is recommended that this part of the conclusion is limited to one page.
