\chapter{Theory and method for e.g. numerical investigations}
In this part of the work, the theory behind the numerical calculations are given. Standard derivations of e.g. the linear finite element method equations will most like belong in an appendix, however, if special elements/features/materials etc. have been used they should be explained here. This is also where the numerical model is explained in detail such as boundary conditions, materials element type etc.
