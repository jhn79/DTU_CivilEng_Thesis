\chapter*{Abstract}
The abstract should sum up the most important findings of the work. However, it should be short (less than one page), precise and without any references to the text, figures, litterature etc. Bear in mind that the abstract is the most read part of your document and it should provide the reader with a sketch of what he or she can find in the full text. The abstract should therefore also be written on a stand-alone basis why unexplained abbreviations should be avoided and familiar terminology should be used.\\

\noindent An abstract should (briefly) provider answers to the following:\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the topic?
  \item What problem do you tackle?
  \item How do you tackle the problem?
  \item What are the key findings of your work?
  \item What are the major conclusions of your work?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent ... and remember that the abstract should preferably fit on one page.
