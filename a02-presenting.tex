\chapter{Presenting your work}

After you have handed in your project you will have to defend it. Such a defend consist of two main parts, namely a presentation of the project and a part where questions relevant to the project are asked. You should not spend more than 25 minutes presenting your work without any interruptions (which is roughly equivalent to 20-30 slides). The slides you are using have to be numbered in case specific slides give raise to questions.

After presenting your work some short general comments are typically made and then questions to the report (and presentation) will be posed. After the questions the examiners will assess the work internally and give you give a grade.

In total the expected time for a defence is typically 60 to 90 minutes depending on project type, supervisor etc.
