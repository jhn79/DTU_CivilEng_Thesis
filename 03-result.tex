\chapter{Results and discussion}

This chapter presents the results obtained in the work, compare the results e.g. experimental and analytical results and discusses the results. It is common to seperate the results and the discussion in two chapters, however, in order to keep a steady flow in the reading one result is presented and graphs or tables or whatever used is explained and discussed just after. However, no final conlusions are drawn at this point. The idea is to present some results in e.g. a graph, explaining neutrally in the text what the graph shows and then start to discuss why the results are reasonable (or why they are not), try to estimate (quantitatively) the sources of error and discuss the trustworthiness of the results. 

If the chapter is divided due to different investigations partial conclusions can also be used...
